              <p>
                Alexander Nathan Skolnick (born September 29, 1968) is an
                American musician. He is best known as the lead guitarist and
                one of the songwriters of the thrash metal band Testament and
                has played with several other bands, including The Alex Skolnick
                Trio, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Savatage and the heavy metal
                supergroup Metal Allegiance. Skolnick began his musical career
                at the age of 15 when he joined Legacy, which eventually became
                Testament, and performed on five albums with them, between The
                Legacy (1987) and The Ritual (1992). By the time he left
                Testament in 1992, Skolnick had found considerable fame among
                the thrash metal and guitar communities.After his first
                departure from Testament, Skolnick went on to pursue various
                musical careers, including briefly replacing Criss Oliva in
                Savatage for their album Handful of Rain (1994), and starting
                his jazz band The Alex Skolnick Trio in the early 2000s, which
                remains active as of 2021. He briefly reunited with Testament in
                2001 for the re-recordings of their early songs on the album
                First Strike Still Deadly, and then returned to the band on a
                permanent basis in 2005, contributing to four more albums.

                Skolnick plays electric ESP Guitars and Godin hollow-bodied
                models with Seymour Duncan pickups. He formerly played Heritage
                and Ibanez guitars. In 2009 Heritage released Alex's first
                signature guitar. His signature is a solid body based upon the H
                150/157 model. In his early years with Testament he endorsed
                Ibanez guitars and mainly played the 540SLTD model. Alex
                endorsed Charvel guitars and was featured in their ads around
                1995. For amplification, he uses Budda amps and several Marshall
                amps including the discontinued Marshall ModeFour hybrid amps.
                In 2013, Budda released a signature amp for Skolnick, called the
                Preceptor, and later in the same year it was announced that
                Skolnick was signed to ESP guitars, with an ESP and LTD model in
                the works for 2014.
